<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self taught designer that seeminly is always jovial, i do get a little emotional at times because i am a deep 
  thinker. i love playing pickleball and i have a nack for learning fun stuff, my prioty first is my relationship with God since
  he is my maker and spiritual father, my second priority is my family as they are my main support system, joy and the place i can truly say i feel at home.  
</p>

<p>My life is truly a whole movie of funnily different characters that happen to be me, sometimes i want to regret some things but not anymore after realizing that most
  of it is actually what made me into the man that i am, i am father, a husband, a brother and a friend and most of a all-timea priest 
  in my home, its not always the way i want things but am thankful for all the lesson and the 
  blessing in my life.
</p>

<p>The truth is not everyone understands me but when they get to they see that this guy is a pretty cool guy, am not really a physical fighter but i fight for what i belive in and somehow i always strive to be the best in whatever 
  i am expose to cause at the end of the day you only live once.
